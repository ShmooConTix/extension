## About / Features
This portion of the bot was done as a concept for a human to do a portion of the ticket purchasing, while the bot does the riddle answering. It was not used in favor of [bot-ts](https://github.com/ShmooConTix/bot-ts). Below are some features of the extension:

- Communicates with API for riddle answer (solved with AI)
- Clicking the `form_` link to initate the ticket purchase process
- Extension toggling via HTML popup
